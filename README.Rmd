The goal of `scotus` is to provide a access to [SCOTUS](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) opinions for use in text analysis. All the data have been taken fro the repository https://github.com/brianwc/bulk_scotus.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EmilHvitfeldt/scotus")
```
## Darta

So far the package only includes 1 dataset, `scotus_sample` which is a random sample of 10% of the total number of opinions (for size reasons).

```{r example}
library(scotus)
str(scotus_sample)
```
